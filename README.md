# 🧠 Real-Time Anomaly & Fraud Detection GPT  
**By Phyllis Barikisu Snyper A**  

A custom GPT project that designs and analyzes real-time anomaly and fraud detection systems using streaming data, machine learning, and AWS-inspired MLOps pipelines.  
This project demonstrates end-to-end data science, AI engineering, and real-time analytics capabilities.

## Project Overview
This GPT is designed to assist data scientists, engineers, and analysts in building and simulating real-time fraud detection systems.  
It integrates ML models, streaming pipelines, and cloud-based deployment strategies inspired by AWS architecture.

**Core Highlights:**
- Real-time fraud detection pipeline (AWS + Kafka + Spark)
- Pre-loaded datasets for credit card, IoT, and banking data
- MLOps architecture with retraining and monitoring logic
- Interactive GPT assistant for code, analysis, and architecture design
- Full testing checklist for model, data, and visualization performance

##  GPT Testing Script
This repository includes a structured testing checklist that evaluates:
1. System understanding  
2. Data analysis capabilities  
3. Machine learning model generation  
4. Architecture reasoning  
5. Visualization and reporting  
6. Scenario simulations  

 

**Testing prompts include examples such as:**
- “Analyze the `creditcard_fraud_sample.csv` dataset for anomalies.”
- “Generate Python code for streaming anomaly detection using PySpark.”
- “Explain the AWS architecture for real-time fraud detection.”
- “Plot anomalies in IoT data over time.”

##  Example Use Case
A financial institution processes millions of transactions per hour.  
This GPT helps design systems that:
- Detect unusual transaction patterns instantly  
- Reduce false positives through model retraining  
- Visualize live anomalies on dashboards  
- Automate alerts through MLOps pipelines
