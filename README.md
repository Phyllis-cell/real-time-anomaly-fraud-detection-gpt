# Real Time Anomaly & Fraud Detection (Custom GPT)

**By Phyllis Barikisu Snyper**

This project documents a **Custom GPT** designed to build and explain real-time anomaly and fraud detection systems using streaming data, machine learning, and cloud tools. It helps users design, simulate, and reason about scalable AI-powered monitoring pipelines.

## About the Custom GPT
The GPT assists with:
- Designing real-time fraud and anomaly detection architectures
- Simulating streaming data (transactions, IoT, events)
- Selecting ML models for time-series anomalies
- Explaining detection logic and trade-offs
- Visualizing anomalies in real time

## Example Prompts
- “Help me build a fraud detection pipeline in Python.”
- “Simulate streaming IoT data for anomaly detection.”
- “Which ML model works best for time-series anomalies?”
- “Show me how to visualize detected anomalies in real time.”

## Platform
- Built using the **GPTs (Custom GPT) platform**
- Model shown may vary (e.g., GPT-5 recommended by the creator interface)

## Notes
This repository focuses on **design, architecture, and usage** of the Custom GPT, not on deploying a production application.
